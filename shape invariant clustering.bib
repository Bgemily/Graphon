abstract = {This paper considers the problem of adaptive estimation of a mean pattern in a randomly shifted curve model. We show that this problem can be transformed into a linear inverse problem, where the density of the random shifts plays the role of a convolution operator. An adaptive estimator of the mean pattern, based on wavelet thresholding is proposed. We study its consistency for the quadratic risk as the number of observed curves tends to infinity , and this estimator is shown to achieve a near-minimax rate of convergence over a large class of Besov balls. This rate depends both on the smoothness of the common shape of the curves and on the decay of the Fourier coefficients of the density of the random shifts. Hence, this paper makes a connection between mean pattern estimation and the statistical analysis of linear inverse problems, which is a new point of view on curve registration and image warping problems. We also provide a new method to estimate the unknown random shifts between curves. Some numerical experiments are given to illustrate the performances of our approach and to compare them with another algorithm existing in the literature.},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with parametric models for populations of curves; i.e. models of the form yi(Z) = f($\theta$i; x) + error, i = I, 2, {\ldots}, n. The shape invariant model f($\theta$i; x) = $\theta$0i + $\theta$1ig([x – $\theta$2i/$\theta$3i) is introduced. If the function g(x) is known, then the $\theta$i may be estimated by nonlinear regression. If g(x) is unknown, then the authors propose an iterative technique for simultaneous determination of the best g(x) and $\theta$i. Generalizations of the shape invariant model to curve resolution are also discussed. Several applications of the method are also presented. {\textcopyright} 1972 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the so-called Shape Invariant Model that is used to model a function f 0 submitted to a random translation of law g 0 in a white noise. This model is of interest when the law of the deformations is unknown. Our objective is to recover the law of the process P f 0 ,g 0 as well as f 0 and g 0. To do this, we adopt a Bayesian point of view and find priors on f and g so that the posterior distribution concentrates at a polynomial rate around P f 0 ,g 0 when n goes to +∞. We then derive results on the identifiability of the SIM, as well as results on the functional objects themselves. We intensively use Bayesian non-parametric tools coupled with mixture models, which may be of independent interest in model selection from a frequentist point of view.},

@article{Gervini2005,
abstract = {A random sample of curves can be usually thought of as noisy realisations of a compound stochastic process X(t) = Z{\{}W(t){\}}, where Z(t) produces random amplitude variation and W(t) produces random dynamic or phase variation. In most applications it is more important to estimate the so-called structural mean $\mu$(t) = E{\{}Z(t){\}} than the crosssectional mean E{\{}X(t){\}}, but this estimation problem is difficult because the process Z(t) is not directly observable. In this paper we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of $\mu$(t). This estimator is shown to be √n-consistent and asymptotically normal under the assumed model and robust to model misspecification. Simulations and a realdata example show that the proposed estimator is competitive with landmark registration, often considered the benchmark, and has the advantage of avoiding time-consuming and often infeasible individual landmark identification. {\textcopyright} 2005 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {Given data from a sample of noisy curves, we consider a nonlinear parametric regression model with unknown model function. An iterative algorithm for estimating individual parameters as well as the model function is introduced under the assumption of a certain shape invariance: the individual regression curves are obtained from a common shape function by linear transformations of the axes. Our algorithm is based on least-squares methods for parameter estimation and on nonparametric kernel methods for curve estimation. Asymptotic distributions are derived for the individual parameter estimators as well as for the estimator of the shape function. An application to human growth data illustrates the method.},
