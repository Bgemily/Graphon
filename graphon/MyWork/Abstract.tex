\begin{abstract}
We propose a dynamic extension of the stochastic block model for growing networks, 
where isolated nodes build connection with each other and develop into a well-organized network.
Our model aims at analyzing typical roles of nodes in the growing procedure, and 
 incorporating the time delay of edges  caused by the various active time of nodes.
% We show the theoretical properties of the proposed least square estimator.
We develop an algorithm based on k-means and shape invariant method.
We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on simulation experiments.
